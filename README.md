# LegnanoVeterinaryClinic <br>

I will model this app for a real veterinary clinic.

I had autorization from the owners of LegnavoVet company to use real informations.

But I'm not an expert devoleper so use this code carefully.

### User interface:

I choose a very simple user interface: 
- a logo image
- a central button bar
- and some description information.


### Used views:
- A vertical linear layout that is the external cointainer, containing:
  - an ImageView, 
  - an horizontal LinearLayout with four Buttons inside, 
  - and two TextView.

The linear layout is wrapped inside a scrollView implementing landscape mode and visualization for little screen device

### Testing:
I tested compatibility with Nexus 5 5.0 1080x1920 xxhdpi

Used content description on image view for screen readers and other accessibility tools
